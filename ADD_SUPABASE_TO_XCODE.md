# Adding Supabase to Xcode Project

## ✅ Package Conflict Fixed
The conflicting `Package.swift` file has been removed. Now you need to add the Supabase dependency directly to your Xcode project.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the Project in Xcode
```bash
open 1V1Mobile.xcodeproj
```

### 2. Add Supabase Package Dependency

1. **In Xcode, go to File → Add Package Dependencies...**
2. **Enter the Supabase Swift package URL**:
   ```
   https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-swift.git
   ```
3. **Click "Add Package"**
4. **Select the "Supabase" product** from the list
5. **Click "Add Package"**

### 3. Add to Target

1. **In the project navigator, select your project** (1V1Mobile)
2. **Select the "1V1Mobile" target**
3. **Go to the "General" tab**
4. **Scroll down to "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content"**
5. **Click the "+" button**
6. **Add "Supabase" from the list**

### 4. Verify Import Works

1. **Open any Swift file** (e.g., `SupabaseService.swift`)
2. **Make sure the import statement works**:
   ```swift
   import Supabase
   ```
3. **Build the project** (Cmd + B) to verify everything compiles

### 5. Clean and Build

1. **Clean Build Folder**: Product → Clean Build Folder (Shift + Cmd + K)
2. **Build Project**: Product → Build (Cmd + B)

## Expected Result

After following these steps:
- ✅ No more package resolution errors
- ✅ Supabase dependency properly linked
- ✅ All `import Supabase` statements work
- ✅ Project builds successfully

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see errors:
1. **Close Xcode completely**
2. **Reopen the project**
3. **Clean build folder again**
4. **Try building**

### If Supabase import fails:
1. **Check that Supabase is listed in "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content"**
2. **Make sure it's added to the correct target**
3. **Try removing and re-adding the package**

## Next Steps

Once Supabase is properly integrated:
1. **Test the connection** using the `test_connection.swift` script
2. **Set up your Supabase backend** using the provided SQL scripts
3. **Configure authentication and storage** as described in the setup guides

## Files Removed
- ✅ `Package.swift` (causing conflict)
- ✅ `Package.resolved` (no longer needed)
- ✅ `.swiftpm/` directory (Swift Package Manager cache)

Your project is now ready for Xcode-based dependency management!
